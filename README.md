# Introduction

This project is another milestone in my triumph over two of my worst nightmares; Responsive Web development and ReactJs.

This project is the capstone project of Kevin Powell's [Conquering Responsive Layout Free Course](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts).

Although, the course uses only HTML and CSS, I chose to take the challenge a little further by building it with ReactJs.

The project is [hosted live on Netlify](https://geoafrikana-crl.netlify.app).

## How to Run this App

First, create a fork of this repo.

Next, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## How to Deploy
Run:
### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed! You can drag-and-drop the build folder to a Netlify.
